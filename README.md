<p>Just a few programming challenges a friend made for me.</p>

<h2>The Trials</h2>
<p>Since we talked about programming challenges, I have had an idea. I wish to challenge you to get 150
Pts before Aug 8th. All of these challenges must be completed in C++. And I worded these as best I could
to be understood. So please go for what you think I was intending to be completed.
Below are the ways that you can get points:</p>

<h3>Nonogram Solver – 50 Pts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Must have a proper board (minimum size of 5x5)</li>
  <li>Must have a way for the user to input number around the board</li>
  <li>Must output the solution</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nonogram Extended – 50 Pts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Solver must work with any size board</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sudoku – 50 Pts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Must have a proper board</li>
  <li>Must have the ability to fill in squares with numbers</li>
  <li>Must automatically pass the user if user’s current solution is valid</li>
  <li>One square cannot hold more than one number</li>
  <li>User able to empty a selected square</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sudoku Extended – 50 Pts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create a randomizing solution in the background</li>
  <li>Randomize squares to be filled in according to the background solution</li>
  <li>The automatic squares cannot be erased</li>
  <li>Create a single button to empty all user-filled-squares</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chess – 50 Pts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Must have a proper board</li>
  <li>Must start with both sides filled with white/black pieces</li>
  <li>Pieces must distinguishable from each other (i.e. I know what is the black queen vs.
    white bishop)</li>
  <li>Pieces must move according to their type (diagonal/forward/sideways/knight’s L move)</li>
  <li>Two pieces cannot occupy the same square</li>
  <li>Must have 2 player capability</li>
  <li>Player 1 controls white</li>
  <li>Player 2 controls black</li>
</ul>

<h3>Chess Extended – 50 Pts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The game prevents any illegal move</li>
  <li>The game must notice if no legal moves exist (i.e. stale mate)</li>
  <li>The game must notice if a king is in check</li>
  <li>Game must declare a winner if a Check Mate occurs</li>
</ul>
